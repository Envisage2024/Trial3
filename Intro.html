<h1> E-Waste </h1>
<p>Electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the fastest growing solid waste streams in the world.
Electronic waste, or e-waste, refers to all items of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) and its parts that have been discarded by its owner as waste without the intent of re-use.
Electronic waste also refers to discarded electrical or electronic devices that have reached the end of their useful life.
These devices can no longer serve their intended purpose due to redundancy, replacement, or breakage.
</p>

<p>E-waste includes a wide range of items, both large and small. Common types of e-waste include:
<ul>
<li>  Computers (desktops, laptops, and tablets) </li>
<li>  Mobile phones and other personal devices (smartphones, e-readers, and so on) </li>
<li> Televisions and monitors (LCD, LED, CRT) </li>
<li>  Household appliances (microwaves, refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines) </li>
<li> Cameras and radios </li>
<li> Printers and scanners </li>
<li> Batteries (including rechargeable ones used in electronics) </li>
<li> Cables, chargers, and power supplies </li>
</ul>
And more!
</p>

<p> Now, let’s dive a bit deeper into what makes e-waste significant. <br>     
<b> Environmental impact: </b> When e-waste is improperly disposed of (such as being dumped in landfills or incinerated), harmful hazardous substances (such as lead, mercury, and cadmium) that can leach into the soil and water, contaminating ecosystems and posing health risks. <br>
<b> Resource wastage: </b> Many electronic devices contain valuable materials like gold, silver, copper, and rare earth elements, which can be recovered through recycling processes. <br>
<b> Data security: </b> Discarded electronics may still contain sensitive information (such as personal data on hard drives or smartphones), which can be a security risk if not properly wiped or destroyed. <br>
<b> Proper disposal and recycling: </b> E-waste recycling involves disassembling devices and recovering valuable materials while ensuring that harmful substances are safely handled.
                Many countries have specific laws and regulations regarding the disposal of e-waste, and there are certified e-waste recycling facilities that follow environmentally responsible practices.
                Recycling e-waste can help conserve natural resources and reduce pollution, making it an important part of sustainability efforts.

                <p>   - E-waste refers to **electronic products and equipment** that have reached the end of their life cycle or are no longer valuable to their current owners. This includes everything from small personal electronics like smartphones and laptops to large appliances like refrigerators and washing machines. Essentially, anything with a power cord or battery can eventually become e-waste³.

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the United States estimates that recycling one million cell phones can recover 35,000 pounds of copper, 772 pounds of silver, 75 pounds of gold, 33 pounds of palladium among others. That is approximately;
    $ 158,900 worth of copper
    $ 224,111.6 worth of silver
    $ 2,454,768 worth of gold
    $ 33,114 worth of palladium
    $ 2,870,893.6 worth of all the above elements
    UGX 10,765,851,000 worth of all the above elements
    
    Key facts. E-waste is one of the fastest growing solid waste streams in the world (1). In 2022, an estimated 62 million tonnes of e-waste were produced globally.1 Oct 2024
    
    Society today revolves around technology and by the constant need for the newest and most high-tech products we are contributing to a mass amount of e-waste.[21] Since the invention of the iPhone, cell phones have become the top source of e-waste products .[citation needed] Electrical waste contains hazardous but also valuable and scarce materials. Up to 60 elements can be found in complex electronics.[22] Concentration of metals within the electronic waste is generally higher than a typical ore, such as copper, aluminium, iron, gold, silver, and palladium.[23] As of 2013, Apple has sold over 796 million iDevices (iPod, iPhone, iPad). Cell phone companies make cell phones that are not made to last so that the consumer will purchase new phones. Companies give these products such short lifespans because they know that the consumer will want a new product and will buy it if they make it.[24][better source needed] In the United States, an estimated 70% of heavy metals in landfills comes from discarded electronics.[25][26]

            <h1>The Growing Problem</h1>
            <p>
                The Growing Problem:
Each year, the world generates an additional 2.5 million tons of e-waste. Radios, toys, phones, laptops—anything with a battery supply—joins this growing mountain of discarded electronics2.
In 2019, a staggering 53.6 million tons of e-waste were generated worldwide. That’s roughly 7.3 kilograms per person, equivalent in weight to 350 cruise ships! Asia led the pack, followed by America, Africa, and Oceania2.
                Rapid Growth Ahead:
                By 2030, the total global e-waste generation is projected to swell to 74.7 million tons, almost doubling the annual amount of new e-waste in just 16 years. Our world’s fastest-growing domestic waste stream is fueled by shorter product lifecycles and limited repair options2.

                14 October Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)
                International E-waste Day​ is a yearly awareness raising celebration initiated by the WEEE Forum and its members and takes place every year on 14 October. It aims to highlight the growing issue of electronic waste and promote responsible e-waste management.</p>
