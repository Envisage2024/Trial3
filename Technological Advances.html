Optical sorting techniques, like infrared and x-ray scanning, help detect different materials for automated separation.
                
                ### 2. **Advanced Metal Recovery Techniques**
                   - **Hydrometallurgical Processes:** Using chemical leaching methods, such as acid and bio-leaching, helps extract valuable metals (gold, silver, copper, etc.) from e-waste with less energy consumption and reduced environmental impact compared to traditional pyrometallurgical methods.
                   - **Biotechnology for Metal Extraction:** Bioleaching uses microorganisms, like bacteria and fungi, to extract metals from e-waste. This method is more eco-friendly, as it reduces the need for toxic chemicals and can be used for low-grade materials that traditional recycling methods cannot process efficiently.
                   - **Electrochemical Processes:** Innovations in electrochemical methods help recover high-purity metals, such as copper, gold, and rare earth elements, by dissolving materials and separating the metals based on their electric properties.
                
                ### 3. **Pyrolysis and Thermal Processing**
                   - **Pyrolysis:** This thermal decomposition technique heats e-waste in an oxygen-free environment, breaking down plastics into synthetic oils or gases that can be used as fuel, and leaving behind valuable metals. This process recovers energy while minimizing toxic emissions.
                   - **Gasification and Plasma Arc Recycling:** Plasma arc technology uses ultra-high temperatures to vaporize e-waste materials, breaking them down into basic elements.
